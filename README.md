# Bugzilla-theme-customization
Simple bugzilla theme customization

Here is an overview of it

![alt tag]https://github.com/benm-stm/Bugzilla-theme-customization/blob/master/overview.png)

Just to be shot, place the folder BlueWave under bugzilla/skins/contrib
Then the skin will be displayed in the preference part of each user (in my case i called the theme ST)

Well it's basic for now, it has to be more custom

Have fun
